                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>
                    Hi there! I’m a passionate 22-year-old developer actively seeking a junior developer role or internship opportunity to grow and apply my skills. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve been interested in software development since my sophomore year of high school, which led me to pursue a degree in the field. However, midway through college, I realized my true passion was in gaining hands-on experience as quickly as possible. This prompted me to leave traditional academia and enroll in a coding bootcamp at Coding Dojo, where I earned a certification in full stack software development. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since graduating, I’ve continued to sharpen my skills, particularly in JavaScript and React, as well as Java and Spring Boot. I am eager to apply my expertise to real-world challenges and contribute to meaningful projects while continuing to grow in the tech industry.
                </p>
